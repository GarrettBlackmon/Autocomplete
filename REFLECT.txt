Impressions:
At first glance this assignment was very confusing to me as I could not Get
BruteForceAutoComplete to work as it should have without modification.
I resolved this by posting in the decusions section on canvis to ask
if anyone else was having the same issue. As it turns out the project
has been modified from its original form and $Autocomplete$ needed to be
added before the AUTOCOMPLETOR_CLASS_NAME constants.

After that was solved there was a lot of trial and error but it was less complex
than I originally expected given I was unable to simply compile the files correctly.
